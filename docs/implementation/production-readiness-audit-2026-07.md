# Engine Production-Readiness Audit — 2026-07-10

Code-grounded audit of the engine across components, execution flow
(source → sink), the three compute engines (batch / delta-batch / streaming),
the three placements (embedded / single-node / distributed), and every API
surface (SQL, Rust, Python, Flight SQL, gateway, MCP, connectors). Every
claim cites code, not docs. This audit is the evidence base for the
platform plan's **Track 6 (phases 51–62): engine production readiness** —
the arc that takes the engine from "certified single-path" to a credible
Spark/Flink alternative for community adoption.

Builds on (does not repeat) the 2026-07-09 core-component audit in
`status.md` (AUD-1..10): AUD-1..4 + AUD-10 are fixed; **AUD-6, AUD-7
(aggregate keys), AUD-8, AUD-9 remain open and are re-confirmed in code
this pass.**

## 1. What the engine is today (verified shape)

- **Workspace**: 25 crates, ~260k LOC Rust, `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`
  across core crates, 4 TODO/FIXME markers total outside tests —
  exceptional hygiene.
- **Three-engine spine** (`krishiv-engine-core/src/lib.rs`): Batch
  (Spark-style bounded SQL), Incremental (DBSP/Feldera-style IVM),
  Streaming (Flink-style event-time + keyed state) — each compiles to a
  `CompiledJob` run by a `ComputeEngine` over placement-injected
  `EngineRuntime` services. Engine × placement × API surface are three
  independent axes; `krishiv-api/src/{conformance,mode_conformance}.rs`
  test the contract.
- **Placements**: embedded (`krishiv-runtime/src/in_process.rs`),
  single-node daemon, distributed (coordinator daemon + executor CLI +
  optional shuffle/flight services). `just check-{embedded,single-node,
  distributed,k8s,full}` builds each.
- **Certified today**: exactly-once Kafka → continuous TUMBLE → Iceberg
  upsert through a mid-commit kill (G8, 2026-07-10, prod k3s) — one
  combination, honestly labeled via registry-published delivery metadata.

## 2. Distributed batch: the single-task ceiling (the #1 gap)

**Finding: a distributed batch SQL job is one stage with one task.**
`submit_batch_sql_job_inner` (`krishiv-scheduler/src/batch_sql.rs:~240`)
builds exactly `stage-sql` / `task-sql` with fragment `sql: <query>`. The
whole query executes on **one executor**; DataFusion parallelizes across
that node's cores, but adding executors adds zero speed to a single
query. "Distributed" batch SQL is remote execution, not scale-out.

Adjacent evidence:

- **The multi-stage path exists but is unreachable from SQL.**
  `job_spec_from_exchange_stages` (`krishiv-scheduler/src/job/scheduler.rs:691`)
  splits a `PhysicalPlan` at `NodeOp::Exchange` boundaries into
  ShuffleMap/Result stages — but tasks are created **one per plan node**,
  not per data partition, and the SQL→plan translation
  (`df_plan_to_krishiv_nodes`, `krishiv-sql/src/lib.rs:2672`) lowers most
  operators to `NodeOp::Other { description }` (display strings) and
  `DfPlan::Repartition` to `Partitioning::Unpartitioned`
  (`lib.rs:2796-2804`). The executor's batch dispatcher has **zero
  `NodeOp::` handling** (`krishiv-executor/src/fragment/batch.rs`) — the
  translated plan drives the optimizer (`BroadcastAutoRule`) and EXPLAIN,
  not execution.
- **Task fragments are strings.** `TypedTaskFragment` wraps
  `body: String` (`krishiv-plan/src/task_fragment.rs`); bodies are `sql:`,
  `stream:loop:`, `delta:step:{job}|{deltas_b64}|{specs_b64}|{state_b64}`.
  Inline tables ride as base64 Arrow IPC in the assignment
  (`BatchSqlInlineTable`). There is no partition-addressed,
  proto-encoded physical plan fragment — the prerequisite for
  partition-parallel task generation.
- **The shuffle crate is production-shaped but under-consumed.**
  `krishiv-shuffle` has hash/range partitioners, sort-shuffle writer +
  index, disk/object-store/tiered stores, an ESS binary, push-shuffle
  (T12), spillable buffers under `UnifiedMemoryManager`, and Arrow-IPC
  Flight transport. Its consumers are the in-memory shuffle fragments and
  hand-built plans — never a SQL query.

**SOTA direction** (phase 52): Ballista proves the architecture on the
same DataFusion base — protobuf plan fragments, stage-per-exchange,
task-per-partition, shuffle-service reads; its published TPC-H SF100
result is 2.9× single-node DataFusion. Iceberg split planning gives the
scan-side parallelism for free (file/split → task), and locality inputs.

## 3. Scheduler: sound skeleton, algorithms parked in `cfg(test)`

Production placement is `SlotAwareScheduler` — greedy most-free-slots
(`krishiv-scheduler/src/job/scheduler.rs:173-233`). What exists but is
**not wired**:

- `LocalityScheduler` (`scheduler.rs:245`, `#[cfg(test)]`): node-local
  preference with greedy fallback; rack tier reserved. Tested, no
  production caller. `ExecutorPlacement::with_locality` is
  `#[expect(dead_code)]`.
- `FairScheduler` (`scheduler.rs:338`, `#[cfg(test)]`): namespace pools —
  and its weight/min-share math is dead code inside its own loop
  (`let _ = min_share…; let _ = total_weight` at `scheduler.rs:439-440`).
- `key_group_range_for_task` + `MAX_KEY_GROUPS = 32_768`
  (`scheduler.rs:15-32`, `#[cfg(test)]`): Flink-style key-group ranges —
  the foundation for parallel keyed streaming — computed nowhere live.

What IS live and good: SC10 resource-profile executor filtering, SC11
cascade circuit breaker + IMM-1 per-executor failure threshold, bounded
assignment fan-out (128 concurrent RPCs, env-tunable), per-endpoint
channel coalescing (#43/#44), round-robin delivery interleaving,
admission `QueueManager` with namespace quota snapshots, one-shot hot-key
`skew_repartition_overrides`, R7.2 adaptive governance types
(hot-key-split / repartition / source-throttle / slow-sink).

Missing entirely: delay scheduling, speculative execution for stragglers,
priority/preemption, task-level retry budgets distinct from stage retry
(P1.24 exists).

## 4. Distributed streaming: one task per job, cycles over RPC

- `prepare_continuous_input_cycle`
  (`krishiv-scheduler/src/coordinator/task_assignment.rs:285`) **requires
  exactly one `stream:loop` task per job** and fences one in-flight cycle.
  Streaming parallelism per job = 1 executor. Input arrives as
  coordinator-pushed partitions in the assignment payload; output drains
  back through the coordinator. There is no executor↔executor streaming
  data plane and no per-channel credit-based flow control (the
  `krishiv-common/backpressure` credits gate **source admission**, not
  network channels).
- **Barrier subsystem: fully built, zero live consumers** (G5 register,
  re-confirmed): `CheckpointCoordinator::try_tick` + 2s
  `barrier_dispatch_loop` run in production;
  `ExecutorTaskRunner::drain_pending_barriers`' only caller is a CLI debug
  command. Chandy-Lamport aligned two-input join
  (`execute_window_join_aligned`, `aligned_join.rs`) is unit-tested with
  no caller; live two-input joins rebuild the operator from scratch every
  cycle (`fragment/streaming.rs` → plain `execute_window_join`) — a
  continuous join loses state at every cycle boundary today.
- Checkpoints are **full-state per cycle**: the executor ships the whole
  operator snapshot each completed cycle; the coordinator persists it
  every cycle. `krishiv-state` has `incremental_checkpoint.rs`,
  `checkpoint/rescaling.rs`, `dfs_backend.rs`, `savepoint.rs`,
  `migration.rs`, TTL — the only reference to incremental checkpoints
  outside the crate is the MCP info endpoint. Built, not wired.

**SOTA direction** (phases 55–56): key-group-sharded continuous jobs;
wire the existing barrier pipeline as the checkpoint driver; Flink-2.0
style disaggregated state (DFS-primary + local cache — `dfs_backend.rs`
is the seed) with incremental checkpoints; savepoint compatibility
windows; unaligned checkpoints later (roadmap already names them).

## 5. Delta-batch / IVM: correct now, doesn't scale yet

Re-confirmed open (post-AUD fixes):

- **AUD-6**: distributed tick ships full state both directions, base64 in
  a string fragment; `MAX_IVM_OFFLOAD_STATE_BYTES = 16 MiB`
  (`ivm_http.rs:387`) silently falls back to central compute — distributed
  IVM never scales past 16 MiB of state; coordinator persists the full
  snapshot every cycle.
- **AUD-7 (remainder)**: `GroupStateMap = AHashMap<Vec<Option<String>>, …>`
  (`krishiv-delta/src/operators/aggregate.rs:299`) — group keys are still
  string tuples (join **traces** got real state in #160; aggregate keys
  and trace probe masks remain string-based).
- **AUD-8**: insert-only snapshot fast path still `concat_batches(prev,
  delta)` (`operators/stream.rs:151`) — O(n) copy per tick, unbounded
  memory; **`register_lateness` still has zero callers**, so lateness GC
  (whose mask AUD-2 fixed) has never actually run.
- **AUD-9**: O(Δ) plan coverage = bare Aggregate / 2-way equi-Join /
  Distinct / WHERE-filtered aggregate; HAVING, agg-over-join, UNION,
  subqueries → DiffBased full recompute + full-output stringify-diff.
- Standing benchmark verdict (#102/G14): even after ctx-reuse, full
  recompute wins below ~23M rows. The IVM engine is a differentiator on
  paper it cannot yet cash at production scale.

## 5b. Security & durability P0s (external review 2026-07-10, code-verified)

An external engine review surfaced end-to-end security and durability
gaps this audit's first passes did not cover (they assumed the Phase-27/P0
security posture was adequate). Verified against the tree:

- **SEC-1 (real): HTTP auth bypass.** `coordinator_http_router`
  (`krishiv-scheduler/src/coordinator_daemon.rs:527-531`) layers the
  bearer middleware only on `protected`, then merges `ivm_routes` and
  `qs_routes` as siblings with no auth — unauthenticated IVM submission
  and raw queryable-state reads.
- **SEC-2 (real, asymmetry): Flight SQL authz.** Statement paths
  fail-closed (`service.rs:371/418/626`); `do_put_prepared_statement_update`
  (`:730`) and `do_action_fallback` (`:1150`) authenticate without the
  policy default-deny. (The review's "normal queries fail with no policy"
  is the intended fail-closed behavior, not a bug.)
- **DUR-1 (real, batch-sink path): false success.** Publish deferred
  outside the write lock (`grpc.rs`), failure only in-memory
  (`coordinator/mod.rs:1724`) → restart can persist `Succeeded` for
  unpublished output. Needs a persisted `Committing` state.
- **DUR-2 (real): prepared sink txns not in durable checkpoints.**
  `EpochTransactionLog.prepared` is in-memory (`two_phase.rs`);
  `CheckpointMetadata`/`CheckpointAckRequest` carry offsets, no
  participant/txn refs — offsets can restore past uncommitted output.
  General-path form of the honest G8 caveat (#171).
- **STALE — do not action as written:** the review's "G7 is an unsafe
  uncommitted draft that drops/recreates the table" predates the tree.
  G7 (`b2dec7b`) + CONN-3 (`9dd1fdf`) are committed; drop/recreate was
  replaced by the crash-safe `overwrite_commit`
  (`iceberg_native.rs:~297`, atomic version-hint flip); the Kafka→Iceberg
  kill-loop it demanded is the certified G8.

→ **Phase 63 (Track 6 GATE 0, P0)** — runs first, gates GA, precedes
Phase 31. Tasks SEC-1/SEC-2/DUR-1/DUR-2.

## 6. Fault tolerance & HA

- Coordinator HA: etcd leader election exists behind `feature = "etcd"`
  (`coordinator_daemon.rs:110`, `etcd_lease.rs`, `leadership.rs`);
  default mode is `single`. Prod runs a single coordinator; failover is
  restart + `store.rs` NDJSON event-log/snapshot recovery (rotation at
  64 MiB, bounded ring). RocksDB/etcd metadata backends exist.
- Executor loss: heartbeat lease → task requeue works (G6 chaos gate 50×
  in CI; DIST-1 loss-counter reset; #81 cycle-boundary race fixed).
  No shuffle-output loss recovery (lost map output ⇒ job failure, not
  stage regeneration) — meaningful once phase 52 makes multi-stage real.
- No speculative re-execution; no completed-job history service (roadmap
  names it); chaos gate stuck at N-small (platform task #98,
  infra-blocked).

## 7. Memory, spill, and large results (healthy)

`krishiv-common/memory_budget` + `UnifiedMemoryManager` feed batch
fragments, dataflow windows/CEP, and shuffle spillables; executor result
spool + chunked fetch (#156) removed the OOM path for large results;
CTAS/DML no longer stream full results over Flight SQL (#162). G2's
mechanism is verified; the TPC-H-at-RAM benchmark remains blocked on
hardware headroom. This area needs *benchmark proof*, not rework.

## 7b. Partitioning across the three engines (sixth pass, 2026-07-10)

- **Shuffle-layer partitioners are rich and mostly parked** (the §2/§3
  pattern again): `HashPartitioner`, `SaltedHashPartitioner` (hot-bucket
  splitting with correct scoping — never keyed streaming),
  `RangePartitioner` with a reservoir-sampling boundary builder (E2.4,
  for GlobalSort/SortMergeJoin), and a full `Partitioning` enum
  (Unpartitioned/Hash/RoundRobin/Broadcast/Range) in `krishiv-plan` —
  but SQL lowers `DfPlan::Repartition` → `Unpartitioned` (§2), so none
  of it is reachable from a query. Phase 52 wires it.
- **"Dynamic partitioning" today = the R7.2 hot-key path**:
  `HeavyHittersTracker` heat reports → source throttle + a one-shot
  `skew_repartition_overrides.insert(job, executor_count)`
  (`executor_ops.rs:233`) that switches the *whole job* to round-robin
  over all executors — batch only, correctly skipped for streaming
  (keyed-state pinning, documented in code). Inversion worth noting: the
  blunt round-robin override is wired while the purpose-built
  `SaltedHashPartitioner` is not. Phase 54 (skew-split on the salted
  partitioner, coalescing, runtime filters) is the fix.
- **The engine can read partitioned Iceberg tables but can never write
  one — the biggest gap found this pass.** Every data file written
  carries `.partition(Struct::empty()).partition_spec_id(0)`
  (`iceberg_native.rs:175`); `PARTITIONED BY` has zero hits in the tree;
  there is no partition-aware fanout writer. Everything Krishiv
  materializes (durable CTAS/G17, the G7/G8 streaming sink, live tables)
  is unpartitioned files — scan pruning (#158) only ever benefits
  externally-written tables, and pruning/compaction degrade with table
  size. → Phase 52 (partitioned table writes task), Phase 60
  (`PARTITIONED BY` grammar), Phase 55 (streaming sink adopts the
  writer), Phase 54 (dynamic partition pruning once tables can be
  partitioned).
- **Streaming source partitions**: single-node picks up new Kafka
  partitions via consumer-group rebalance (C6, `kafka.rs:1116`); the
  coordinator-fed distributed path has no dynamic split discovery —
  a topic that grows partitions needs a restart. → Phase 55.
- **IVM has no partitioning dimension at all** — and Phase 57
  deliberately keeps one executor per IVM job (executor-resident state
  is the step that pays). Key-group-sharded IVM is recorded in Phase 57
  as an explicit post-phase follow-on, not a GA requirement.

## 8. API surfaces

- **SQL**: DataFusion pinned at 53.1 / arrow 58.3 / iceberg 0.9.1
  (`Cargo.toml`); upgrade train tracked (#163 for iceberg 0.10 + DF 54
  alignment). Session layer, prepared statements ($N + JDBC `?` G12),
  SQLSTATE taxonomy (`krishiv-sql/src/sqlstate`).
- **SQL language coverage** (second pass, 2026-07-10): broader than
  typical — `krishiv-sql` ships a machine-readable ~90-entry feature
  matrix (`grammar.rs`), Spark extensions (`spark_sql_ext.rs`: LATERAL
  VIEW [OUTER], TABLESAMPLE, TRANSFORM, DESCRIBE EXTENDED, SHOW
  TBLPROPERTIES), PIVOT/UNPIVOT rewrites, recursive CTEs,
  ROLLUP/CUBE/GROUPING SETS, Spark 4 pipe syntax, a MATCH_RECOGNIZE
  subset (no DEFINE/MEASURES), Iceberg MERGE/DELETE/UPDATE and durable
  CTAS (G17), `CREATE FUNCTION … LANGUAGE SQL|PYTHON`. **Verified
  missing**: the entire JSON function family (`get_json_object`,
  `from_json`/`to_json`, `json_tuple` — zero hits in the tree),
  higher-order array/map lambdas (`transform`, `filter`, `aggregate`,
  `zip_with`), Spark session statements (`SET`/`RESET`, `USE`,
  `TRUNCATE`, `CACHE`), most of the `SHOW` family, `DESCRIBE
  FUNCTION|DATABASE|QUERY`, join hints beyond BROADCAST, Spark
  date-format patterns. The matrix itself has **drifted** (CTAS still
  marked Partial after G17), and only ~17 engine-side UDF registrations
  exist — the function library is essentially DataFusion's builtin set.
  → Phase 60 (measured Spark-reference parity).
- **SQL across the three engines** (fifth pass, 2026-07-10): the language
  has **three front doors**. Batch = full DataFusion planner +
  extensions; streaming = `compile_streaming_window_sql`
  (`streaming_window_plan.rs`, a hand-written AST matcher: plain SELECT
  only, exactly one TUMBLE/HOP/SESSION TVF, whitelisted aggregates, no
  joins/HAVING/subqueries); IVM = `IncrementalViewSpec.sql` into the
  delta planner (AUD-9 coverage, silent DiffBased fallback). The same
  window-TVF syntax is implemented **twice** (batch rewrites to scalar
  UDFs in `streaming_tvf.rs`; streaming hand-compiles) — the
  `SUM(CASE WHEN)` 409 (fixed `7b720ea`) was this divergence class in
  prod, and it recurs per construct until the front door is shared. No
  SQL DDL reaches streaming or IVM (no `CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW`, no
  streaming `CREATE TABLE`/`INSERT INTO … SELECT`; continuous jobs are
  API/HTTP-only via `continuous_stream_http.rs`) — a Flight SQL/JDBC/BI
  client can never touch two of the three engines. `grammar.rs`'s
  `FeatureEntry` has a single `status`, so "supported-batch,
  partial-streaming" is unrepresentable and measured coverage silently
  means batch. No differential tests assert batch(q) ≡ streaming(bounded
  replay) ≡ IVM snapshot for the shared subset, though the oracle is
  free (DiffBased fallback *is* batch recompute). → Phase 60
  (engine-dimensioned matrix, one parser front door, cross-engine DDL,
  differential corpus), operator execution coverage in 55/57.
- **API fragmentation across the three engines** (third pass, 2026-07-10):
  the Python surface has a strong PySpark-shaped base — `PyDataFrame`
  with ~60 methods (select/filter/group_by/join/pivot/cube/rollup/
  sample/cache/…), `col()`/`Column` expressions, `session.read_stream()`
  + `df.write_stream()` — but a user faces **five parallel idioms**:
  (1) batch `DataFrame`; (2) structured-streaming
  `DataStreamReader/Writer`; (3) a Flink-style DataStream layer
  (`KeyedStream`/`WindowedStream`/`ConnectedStreams`/process functions +
  state types); (4) the raw IVM job protocol — `session.ivm()` →
  `register_view(sql, SchemaClass)` → `feed(DeltaBatch.from_inserts(…))`
  → `step()` → `snapshot()`, with user-visible `_weight` columns
  (`krishiv-python/src/incremental.rs`) — the least friendly path for
  the differentiator engine; (5) live-tables/pipelines. Method-variant
  sprawl compounds it (`filter`/`filter_column`,
  `select`/`select_columns`/`select_exprs`, `except_`/`except_all`/
  `except_distinct`, `*_with_options` twins). The Rust `krishiv-api`
  mirrors the same fragmentation (Session / DataFrame / StreamingBuilder
  / StreamingDataFrame / MaterializedTable / IvmJob). The engine-core
  spine promises one contract across engines; the API layer doesn't
  deliver it yet. → Phase 61 (unified DataFrame API, PySpark parity,
  delta-batch demoted to an internal protocol).
- **Sync/async: three calling conventions, none complete** (fourth pass,
  2026-07-10). Rust is **sync-first** (`Session::sql` at
  `session.rs:2165`, `DataFrame::collect` at `dataframe.rs:509` — both
  cross the `block_on` bridge), with ~20 `_async` twin methods
  (`sql_async`, `collect_async`, `read_*_async`, …) AND a partial
  8-method `BlockingSession` facade (`blocking.rs`, 151 lines) — three
  ways to run one query. The bridge itself
  (`krishiv-common/src/async_util.rs`) is well-engineered — it correctly
  handles multi-thread (`block_in_place`), current-thread (fresh-OS-
  thread hop around Tokio's per-thread nesting guard), and no-runtime
  (lazy fallback runtime, B3 thread cap) contexts — but every "sync"
  call inside an embedder's async app borrows a runtime worker. Python
  mirrors it: `Session` mixes sync methods (27 GIL-release sites — good
  discipline, not total) with method-by-method coroutines via
  `pyo3-async-runtimes` (`sql_async`, the B-1 fix) plus a separate
  `BlockingSession` pyclass. Engine internals are largely disciplined
  (`spawn_blocking` for storage I/O in shuffle/executor; sharded
  coordinator bypasses hot-path locks) but the GAP-4 hazard class (locks
  held across await) is policed by comments, not lints. → Phase 61
  (single sync/async contract: async-first Rust core + one complete
  blocking facade; Python sync-by-default + systematic async mirror) and
  Phase 51 (async hygiene as clippy lints: `await_holding_lock`,
  `disallowed-methods` for `block_on` in async contexts).
- **Flight SQL**: metadata RPCs + JDBC/ADBC verified (G1);
  `krishiv-sql-gateway` is explicitly **not** a wire server (API-12
  header) — an in-process SQLSTATE facade. There is no Postgres/JDBC
  wire endpoint besides Flight SQL. Query progress + cancellation are
  roadmap items, not implemented surfaces.
- **Python**: 12.5k LOC PyO3. A non-compiling `PySession::close` shipped
  in `1694143` — the per-PR `test-python` CI job did not block it
  (status.md 2026-07-09); CI honesty gap.
- **MCP**: 3.3k LOC single file, read-only ops surface. **UI**: 2.4k LOC
  embedded console. Both fine for scope.
- **Connectors**: ~30 sources/sinks with SDK, registry, maturity
  certification (`certification.rs`) — the strongest crate; the platform
  ADR-0021 confirms it as the connector home.

## 9. Testing & release infrastructure

Strong: per-mode build/test recipes, chaos crate + G6 kill-loop CI gate,
conformance suites, api-surface freeze (`api/` + CI check), cargo-deny,
release skill with signed checksums, BENCHMARKING.md discipline. Gaps: no
SQL correctness corpus (sqllogictest-style), no distributed-scale CI
(single machine), `test-python` not blocking, no benchmark **history**
publication (roadmap item 5), no soak gate in engine CI (soaks are
platform-driven).

## 10. Verdict → Track 6 (platform phases 51–63)

The engine's architecture (spine, seams, hygiene, certification
discipline) is production-grade; its **scale story is not**: one-task
batch jobs, one-task streaming jobs, 16 MiB IVM offload, test-gated
scheduler algorithms, unwired incremental checkpoints/barriers, single
coordinator. The pattern is consistent — correct narrow paths shipped
first, scale machinery built but parked. Track 6 wires and proves it, in
dependency order:

| Phase | Theme | Kills |
|---|---|---|
| 51 | Baseline: wire-or-delete audit, version train, correctness corpus, honest CI | parked-subsystem drift; DF 53 pin; test-python gap |
| 52 | Distributed batch v2: proto fragments, partition-parallel stages, real shuffle | §2 single-task ceiling |
| 53 | Scheduler v2: locality, fair pools, speculation, priority | §3 cfg(test) algorithms |
| 54 | AQE + statistics: coalescing, skew split, runtime filters | §3 one-shot skew; no stats |
| 55 | Streaming v2: key-group parallel jobs, live barriers, continuous joins | §4 one-task streaming; G5 |
| 56 | State v2: incremental + disaggregated checkpoints, rescaling, savepoint windows | §4 full-state-per-cycle |
| 57 | IVM scale-out: executor-resident state, arrow-row keys, retention, coverage | §5 AUD-6/7/8/9 |
| 58 | Fault tolerance GA: coordinator HA, shuffle recovery, history server, chaos matrix | §6 |
| 59 | Interfaces: progress/cancel, wire protocol decision, Python parity, CI honesty | §8 |
| 60 | SQL surface completeness: measured Spark-reference parity (JSON/lambda functions, SET/SHOW/USE, matrix drift) | §8 SQL coverage |
| 61 | Unified DataFrame API: one surface, three engines, PySpark parity; delta-batch demoted to internal protocol; single sync/async contract | §8 API fragmentation + sync/async |
| 62 | Production GA gate: certified matrix, public benchmarks + history, soak | the launch |

Two cross-cutting observations that individual phases only cover
implicitly, named here so they don't survive partially (2026-07-10,
end-of-session review):

- **Coordinator must become control-plane-only.** Every distributed data
  path today transits the coordinator: batch inline tables ride base64 in
  assignments (§2), streaming input is coordinator-pushed and output
  coordinator-drained per cycle (§4), IVM state round-trips per tick with
  the 16 MiB cliff (§5). Phases 52/55/57 each remove their leg; by Phase
  58 entry, query data on coordinator RPC is a regression, not a
  workaround.
- **The stringly-typed fragment protocol dies once, not per-engine.**
  `TypedTaskFragment.body: String` with `sql:` / `stream:loop:` /
  `delta:step:` prefixes spans all three engines; Phase 52's fragment ADR
  defines the typed proto envelope for all three body kinds, and 55/57
  adopt it.
- **SEC-1's pattern needs a surface sweep (SEC-3, Phase 63).** The
  merged-outside-middleware pattern was verified only on the two routers
  the external review named; the embedded console, MCP server,
  metrics/health endpoints, executor-side HTTP, and shuffle/Flight data
  services have not been audited against it.

Phase detail, gates, and platform-side seams live in the platform repo:
`docs/implementation/phases/phase-NN-*.md` and `plan.md` (Track 6).

### SOTA references consulted (2026-07-10)

- Morsel-driven parallelism / NUMA work-stealing (Leis et al., SIGMOD'14) —
  intra-node scheduling; DataFusion's streaming push model already gets
  comparable intra-node scaling, so Track 6 spends effort on *inter-node*.
- Apache DataFusion Ballista 53 (May 2026 release): scheduler/executor +
  shuffle architecture on the same DF base; TPC-H SF100 2.9× single-node.
- Flink 2.0 disaggregated state / ForSt (VLDB'25) + async execution model;
  credit-based flow control (FLINK-7282) as the streaming data-plane model.
- Spark AQE (coalesce/skew-split/dynamic broadcast) + runtime filters;
  push-based/remote shuffle (Magnet, Celeborn, Uniffle) as the shuffle
  service end-state — `krishiv-shuffle`'s ESS/push/tiered stores map to it.
- Delay scheduling (Zaharia et al., EuroSys'10) for the locality tier;
  speculative execution per MapReduce/Spark for stragglers.
- DBSP/Feldera (already the delta crate's declared basis) for IVM
  operator coverage direction.
